# Rock Paper Scissors Game (C++)

## Description
A C++ console-based Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.  
The project demonstrates basic C++ programming concepts such as input/output, loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

## Features
- User vs computer gameplay
- Menu-based input system
- Random computer choice
- Input validation
- Option to exit the game

## Technologies
- C++
- Standard Library (iostream, cstdlib)

## How to Play
1. Run the program
2. Choose:
   - 1 for Rock  
   - 2 for Paper

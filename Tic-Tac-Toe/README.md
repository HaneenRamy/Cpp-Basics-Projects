# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (C++)

## Description
A C++ console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.  
The project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, and conditional statements.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay (X and O)
- Clear console-based board display
- Input validation
- Automatic win and tie detection
- Simple and interactive user interface

## Technologies
- C++
- Console input/output

## How to Play
1. Run the program
2. Players take turns entering a row and column (1–3)
3. The board updates after each move
4. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio or VS Code
2. Compile the source file
3. Run the executable
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced using 2D arrays
- Applied functions for modular code design
- Implemented game logic and input validation
- Improved problem-solving skills in C++

# Guess the Number Game (C++)

## Description
A C++ console-based Guess the Number game where one player sets a secret number and the other player tries to guess it.  
The game provides feedback on how many digits are correct and in the right position, and how many digits are correct but misplaced.  
This project demonstrates basic C++ concepts such as strings, loops, conditionals, and simple arrays.

## Features
- Host sets a secret number
- Player guesses the number
- Feedback for correct digits in the right place
- Feedback for correct digits in the wrong place
- Input validation (number length)
- Loop until the correct guess is made

## Technologies
- C++
- Console input/output
- Strings

## How to Play
1. Run the program
2. One player enters a secret number
3. The other player enters guesses
4. The program shows:
   - How many digits are correct and in the right place
   - How many digits are correct but misplaced
5. Repeat until the number is guessed correctly

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio or VS Code
2. Compile the source file
3. Run the executable
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced using strings and arrays
- Applied loops and conditionals
- Implemented logic for checking positions and correctness
- Improved problem-solving and logical thinking in C++
